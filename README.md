# Loan-Default-prediction-model
This repository contains two jupyter notebooks: one for cleaning, and another for EDA and classification.

The dataset used is a large and rich dataset from the U.S. Small Business Administration.

The SBA assists small businesses through a loan guarantee program, in that they act much like an insurance provider to reduce the risk for a bank by taking on some of the risk through guaranteeing a portion of the loan. In the case that a loan goes into default, SBA then covers the amount they guaranteed.

The dataset used for this model contains loans that have been successfully repaid as well as loans that have gone into default. Here we attempt to do predictive analysis to determine if we should approve or deny a loan i.e. we try to determine if a loan application would eventually go into default.
